# A lane narrowing Before/After analysis of speed data

For detailed step by step analysis, open the [process details](https://github.com/gishar/BeforeAfter/blob/main/ProcessDetails.rmd) file. 
For the codes, open the Part 1 and Part 2 R scripts.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to see if narrowing the lanes has any effects on driver speed.

## Data

The data includes 24 hours of individual speed data at three different locations in both directions of travel for: - before condition - after condition (1 month after) - after condition (4 months after). Here are some details on the locations:

-   Residential street
-   Speed limit 25 mph
-   *Before* condition road width 24 ft, between edges of pavement (not curb to curb), no edge lines
-   *After* condition road width 20 ft, edge lines 2 ft from edge of pavement, no center line
-   AADT (Average Annual Daily Traffic) of 2000 vehicles per day

## Analysis Process

The analysis of this data will include the following steps:

1.  Cleaning
2.  Aggregation
3.  EDA - Visual before/after comparisons
4.  Statistical before/after comparisons

## Conclusions
